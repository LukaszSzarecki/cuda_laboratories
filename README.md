This repository contains the code for all the labs in the Parallel Programming Course.

## 1. laboratory - prime numbers

#### Environment
 * Operating System: Windows 10 Home
 * GPU: NVIDIA GTX 660
 * CUDA version: 11

#### Introduction
The lab involved writing a program to check if a given number is prime. The program was to be run on GPU and CPU.As a result, execution times on the CPU and GPU had to be compared. 
#### Results
 - The GPU needs approximately 140 [us] for each number to allocate memory and transfer data to the device
 - For 32-bit numbers and above, the gpu is faster than the CPU 
 - For a 61-bit number, the CPU operation time is about 3.4s while the GPU handles the problem in 0.2s
